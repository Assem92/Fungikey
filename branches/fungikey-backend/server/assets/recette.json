Reduce the heat to medium low, add the parsley and 1 teaspoon salt and simmer, stirring a few times, until thick, about 1 hour, 30 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. (you can make the ragu up to 1 day ahead; let cool, then cover and chill. Reheat before using.)\r\n\r\n4. Make the lasagna filling: Mix the parmesan, mozzarella and asiago; set 1 1\/2 cups of the cheese mixture aside. Combine the remaining cheese mixture in a large bowl with the ricotta, eggs, spinach, nutmeg and 1\/2 teaspoon salt.\r\n\r\n5. Preheat the oven to 375F. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a generous amount of salt. Add the noodles and cook as the label directs. Drain and rinse under cold water; shake off the excess water.\r\n\r\n6. Spread 1 cup of the ragu in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Add a layer of noodles, then half of the spinach mixture and 2 cups ragu. Repeat with another layer of noodles, spinach mixture and ragu. Top with the remaining noodles and ragu and sprinkle with the reserved cheese. Cover with foil, place on a baking sheet and bake 50 minutes. Uncover and bake until golden, about 25 more minutes.
